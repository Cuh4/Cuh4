<!-- About me -->
<h3 align="center">I'm a passionate programmer from the UK.</h3>

I know `Lua`/`Luau` (3-4 years) and `Python` (2 years) alongside `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS` (all 2-3 months).

I created and own [cuhhub.com](https://cuhhub.com). A community built around the game Stormworks: Build and Rescue offering servers with unique gamemodes coded from scratch. Additionally, I've created many public, open-source addons (mods) for the same game that plenty of players have subscribed to and used.

Aside from programming, I'm also familiar with video editing, image editing, game development and more.
