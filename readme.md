# Heyo, I'm Cuh4.
<p align="center">
    I am a <b>self-taught</b> programmer from the <b>United Kingdom</b> (yuck) that absolutely sucks at crafting commit messages.
    I'm mainly known for<b>creating addons</b> in a videogame titled <b>Stormworks: Build and Rescue</b>. I also conveniently host a few <a href="https://dsc.gg/cuhhubsw">multiplayer servers (cuhHub)</a> on the same game for people to play on and mess around together.
</p>

    I only speak English, just an FYI.

        <a href="https://github.com/Cuh4/NoMoreOilSpills">No More Oil Spills</a>
    </p>
</h3>

<p align="center">
    This is an addon for Stormworks: Build and Rescue that is used by quite a lot of people within the game's community.
</p>

<h3>
    <p align="center">
        <a href="https://github.com/Cuh4/messageFetch">Message Fetch</a>
    </p>
</h3>

<p align="center">
    Discord bot that retrieves x amount of messages in a specified channel and dumps it into a .json file. Somewhat configurable. Quite rushed, but the code is nice.
</p>

<h3>
    <p align="center">
        <a href="https://github.com/Cuh4/DiscordChatbot">Discord Chatbot</a>
    </p>
</h3>

<p align="center">
    Discord bot that, when pinged, replies with an AI-generated response. The chatbot aspect of the bot utilises the ChatterBot Python package.
</p>

        <a href="https://github.com/Cuh4/AuroraFramework">Aurora Framework</a>
    </p>
</h3>

<p align="center">
    This is an OOP-based framework that <b>significantly</b> helps with creating addons in Stormworks: Build and Rescue. The code is very clean and the framework is overall helpful and reliable. All of my newer addons use this framework.
</p>

<h3>
    <p align="center">
        <a href="https://github.com/Cuh4/AllCreaturesHateYou">All Creatures Hate You</a>
    </p>
</h1>

<p align="center">
    This is yet another addon for Stormworks: Build and Rescue. This addon effectively makes all creatures chase you down and kill you. The code is pretty clean too.
</p>

    <p align="center">
        <a href="https://github.com/Cuh4/NextbotAddon">Nextbot Addon</a>
    </p>
</h3>

<p align="center">
    This addon is quite scrapped, but I felt that the code was very clean hence why I plopped this here.
