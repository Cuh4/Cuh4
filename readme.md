### Heyo, I'm Cuh4.
I am a **self-taught** programmer from the **United Kingdom** (yuck).
I'm mainly known for **creating addons** in a videogame titled **Stormworks: Build and Rescue**. I also conveniently host a few [multiplayer servers (cuhHub)](https://discord.gg/zTQxaZjwDr) on the same game for people to play on and mess around together.

I only speak English, just an FYI.


![Languages](resources/languages.png)
- ### **Lua** - 2+ years - Quite experienced.
- ### **Python** - 1 year - Pretty experienced.
> ⚠ **Note** - I'm planning to learn more programming languages soon, particularly JavaScript so I can get into proper web development.

This section will show off **most of my best** projects, check 'em out!
#
### [**No More Oil Spills**](https://github.com/Cuh4/NoMoreOilSpills)
This is an addon for Stormworks: Build and Rescue that is used by quite a lot of people within the game's community.
#
### [**Aurora Framework**](https://github.com/Cuh4/AuroraFramework)
This is an OOP-based framework that **greatly** helps with creating addons in Stormworks: Build and Rescue. The code is very clean and the framework is overall helpful and reliable. All of my newer addons use this framework.
#
### [**All Creatures Hate You**](https://github.com/Cuh4/AllCreaturesHateYou)
This is yet another addon for Stormworks: Build and Rescue. This addon effectively makes all creatures chase you down and kill you. The code is pretty clean too.
#
### [**Nextbot Addon**](https://github.com/Cuh4/NextbotAddon)
This addon is quite scrapped, but I felt that the code was very clean hence why I plopped this here.
